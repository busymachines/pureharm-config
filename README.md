# pureharm-config

Version ~~0.2.0~~0.3.0 is end of the line for `pureharm-config` it is being superseded by `pureharm-config-ciris` which dramatically alters the way configs are dealt with. So it's no small change. Starting with versions `0.2.0` downstream pureharm moduls (e.g, db-slick, db-doobie, aws, etc) will deprecate the usage of the `ConfigLoader` companion objects for their configurations and encourage users to use `ciris` to read the configs on user side with the prefered method. Starting with version `0.3.0` no downstream module will be coupled with the concrete method of reading configs anymore, it will all be left in user-land, and recommended to be done w/ `pureharm-config-ciris`.

The latter approach has many advantages, including easier publishing of the whole pureharm thing.

See [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).
